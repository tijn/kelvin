## [0.2.0] - 2020-05-08

### Added

- multiplication and division of temperatures

### Changed

- It's now easier to override (monkey patch) the locale that's used to determine if output should be in °C or °F

### Removed

- body_temperature. I question its usefulness and it should be a range anyways. (The normal human body temperature range is typically stated as 36.5–37.5 °C )
